This plugin for those who want to cut the time of writing SEO components of an article.
Simply add non-empty text and hit "Convert to SEO", and this will generate keywords and descriptions.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
