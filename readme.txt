This plugin converts any plain text into the main SEO components, 160 chars description, keywords and Tags

== Description ==

This plugin aims to cut down the time of writing SEO components of an article.
Simply add non-empty text into "Sentence" field and hit "Convert to SEO", and this will generate keywords and 160 chars descriptions.
If certain keywords appear more than once, then that will show up in the Tags field as suggested tags.

You could also use this plugin to store permanent keywords that should be used on every post/page.
Likewise this plugin accommodates storing stopwords (ignore list) so it won't show up in the generated keywords section.

1. Upload `SentenseToSEO` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to 'Settings' on the left hand side then select "SentenceToSEO"
